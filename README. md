**Designing Tools for Co-exploration: A Guideline to Support Remote Design Collaboration**

This mini research article presents the **DTC (Designing Tools for Co-exploration) guideline**, a structured set of design considerations developed to support **remote co-exploration** in design collaboration.

The guideline was developed based on expert insights and structured around three conceptual spaces of collaboration:
- **Meeting Space**
- **Working Space**
- **Project-specific Space**

It offers practical prompts to help **tool designers** and **design teams** think critically about how to improve remote design collaborationâ€”not by replicating co-located tools, but by addressing the social, material, and interactional dynamics that support emergent co-exploration.

## ðŸ§¾ Abstract

> Co-exploration plays an important role in collaborative design practices. It refers to the shared, emergent experience through which team members engage with design challenges togetherâ€”merging, reflecting, diverging, refining in ways that propel the design forward. While this experience is reported to be significantly lost in remote collaboration, we investigate how to create conditions that enable co-exploration to occur when design teams are not co-located.  
>  
> This article presents the Designing Tools for Co-exploration (DTC) guideline, developed from expert visions of future remote design practices. Grounded in those insights, the guideline offers intermediate-level design knowledge to support remote co-exploration. The guidelineâ€”structured across three types of collaborative spacesâ€”serves as a reflective prompt for tool developers and collaborating designers alike.
